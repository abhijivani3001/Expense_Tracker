<input
            type="text"
            value={EnteredTitle}
            onChange={TitleHandler}
></input>

in input tag "onchange" its react inbuilt props to send data(listener) from parent to child

but sending data from child to family we define our own props 
like this
e.g i need  send form data to DummyExpenses which in App.js
so path => ExpenseForm sends to NewExpense and NewExpense sends to App
1)
in New Expense we create props = onSaveExpenseData which calls SaveExpenseDataHandler function
<ExpenseForm onSaveExpenseData={SaveExpenseDataHandler} />
2)
then we create SaveExpenseDataHandler function in New Expense file
const SaveExpenseDataHandler = (EnteredExpenseData) => {
    const expensesdata = {
      ...EnteredExpenseData,
    };
    console.log(expensesdata);
  };
3)
set function paramter in ExpenseForm
parameter=props
const ExpenseForm = (props) => 
4)
send data through function call in ExpenseForm
props.onSaveExpenseData(expensesdata);
data=expensesdata
